# Technical Deep Dive: Polymorphic Shellcode Engine

## Architecture
1. **Mutation Engine**
   - Junk Instruction Insertion
   - Register Swapping
   - Instruction Reordering

2. **Encryption Scheme**
   - XOR with PBKDF2-derived Key
   - Self-decrypting Stub (x64)

3. **Evasion Techniques**
   - Sandbox Detection (RAM/VM checks)
   - API Hashing

## Components

### Payload Generation
- Uses Keystone Engine for assembly
- Supports x86/x64 architectures
- Pre-built templates (reverse TCP, etc.)

### Polymorphism Workflow
1. Original Shellcode → Mutation → Encryption → Decryptor Stub

### Cobalt Strike Integration
- Generates `.cna` scripts for direct loading
- Obfuscates payload in memory

## Limitations
- Currently x64-focused
- Basic XOR encryption (extend with AES)
- Windows-only evasion checks

## Future Work
1. Add ARM architecture support
2. Implement entropy-based mutation
3. Add process hollowing integration
